# Animation Learning Project

This project was created as part of my journey to learn animations using third-party libraries like Locomotive Scroll, Sheryjs, and Gasp. I followed a tutorial on YouTube to implement these animations and gain hands-on experience with these libraries.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this project is to explore and understand how to incorporate animations into web development, specifically leveraging external libraries. It serves as a learning exercise to enhance my skills in creating dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces.

## Next Steps

My next goal for this project is to make it responsive independently, without relying on external tutorials. Achieving responsiveness will further enhance the user experience and ensure that the project looks great on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
